## Project

The goal of the project was to deliver a static website to a client. 
Together with my fellow students <a href="http://www.stijnbeckers.digital/" target="_blank">Stijn</a> and <a href="https://jarnopeeters.be/" target="_blank">Jarno</a> we created a one pager with some bootstrap integration.
From all the students our project was selected for publication.
